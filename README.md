Welcome to Samplr! This application allows users to experiment with various bass effects and cabsims, as well as test combinations of these effects. Additionally, users can sign up for updates on new effects and features through our mailing list.

## Features

- Effect Testing: Users can explore a range of bass effects and cabsims, testing them individually to find their desired sound.
- Combination Testing: The application enables users to combine multiple effects and cabsims together to create unique and personalized tones.
- Mailing List: Users can sign up for our mailing list to stay updated on the latest additions to the effects library and new features.
- Effects and Cabsims: Current Listing of effects and cabsims are pulled from the Darkglass e500 amp.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: The application is built on Node.js, providing a robust and scalable server-side runtime environment.
- MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the database to store user information, effects, cabsims, and audio.
- Mongoose: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a simple and structured way to interact with the database.
- Express: Express.js is utilized as the web application framework, enabling easy and efficient handling of HTTP requests and routes.
- JavaScript: The primary programming language used for the backend and frontend development.
- HTML: HTML is used for creating the structure and content of web pages.
- CSS: CSS is utilized for styling and enhancing the visual presentation of the application.

## Coming Soon

- More bass lines, more effects and more cabsims to test out the capabilities of the [Darglass e500](https://www.darkglass.com/creation/exponent-500/)
